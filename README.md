# RGA_PID_Optimization_NeuralNetwork
This project demonstrates how to use RGA Genetic Algorithm to generate training data, and then use this data to train a neural network model, ultimately achieving Adaptive PID Controller Tuning. This method optimizes the PID parameters automatically to improve the performance of control systems.
